                    <p>HLVF attempts to <b>solve</b> the issues that occur with <b>conventional means of feedback</b>.
                    Specifically, by being giving students the opportunity to <b>recurrently</b> provide feedback from any device with access to
                    the Internet, by achieving <b>anonymity</b> since it does not require students to input any sort of credentials in order
                    to participate to answering process, by assisting students with <b>conveying their emotions</b>
                    by supporting affective feedback and finally by <b>motivating</b> them by applying gamification techniques to the platform.</p>

                    <p>HLVF aims to motivate students to conveniently and anonymously provide recurrent, honest and affective feedback regarding the
                    lectures they attend. Additionally, allow instructors to have access to <b>truthful and meaningful
                    insight</b> on how effective and understandable their lectures are as well as derive to conclusions and
                    dynamically adapt according to the feedback they receive and finally, establish a continuous and <b>genuine
                    connection</b> with each other in a unique way in order to enhance the studentâ€™s learning experience.</p>
